Place the `Onboard` component anywhere in your app. It will automatically take up the entire screen.

```jsx
import Onboard from 'react-native-onboard-carousel';

const App = function () {
  return (
    <Onboard
      slides={[
        {
          id: 1,
          img: './assets/image1.png',
          title: 'Ride like a king',
          subtitle: 'The future of transport is now in your hands',
          outro: 'Starting from $10',
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          img: './assets/image2.png',
          title: 'Order in real time',
          subtitle: 'At the best rates',
          outro: '$99.99 Cap',
        },
        {
          id: 3,
          img: 'https://image.similarpng.com/very-thumbnail/2022/03/Red-car-on-transparent-background-PNG.png',
          title: 'Some other important text',
          subtitle: 'Some subtitle',
          webImage: true,
        },
      ]}
      skipEnabled={true}
      onDone={() => console.log('Move to another screen')}
      backgroundColor={'#fff'}
    />
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Using server images

If you wish to load your image assets from the web rather than from your project, you can type in the web url.

<!-- ```jsx
img: 'https://me.com/img/cute_cat_pic3266421.png'
``` -->

## Customization

`react-native-onboard-carousel` is designed to be very customizable. You can use the default UI or create your own by implementing the provided interfaces
