```jsx
import Onboard from 'react-native-onboard-carousel';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Onboard
      slides={[
        {
          id: 1,
          img: require('./assets/image1.jpeg'),
          title: 'Ride like a king',
          subtitle: 'The future of transport is now in your hands',
          outro: 'Join us',
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          img: require('./assets/image2.jpeg'),
          title: 'Order in real time',
          subtitle: 'At the best rates',
          outro: 'Join Us',
        },
      ]}
    />
  );
};
```

``` -->
